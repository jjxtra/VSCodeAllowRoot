# VSCodeAllowRoot
The last working version of VS code that allowed running as root. Please for the love of God Microsoft add this back. There are plenty of use-cases where sudo type commands must be issued from a priviliged service. Think firewalls or other security software...

The original file name was code_1.65.2-1646927742_amd64.deb, but I have renamed it to vscode_allow_root.deb.
